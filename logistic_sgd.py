Logistic regression is a probabilistic, linear classifier. It is parametrized
by a weight matrix :math:`W` and a bias vector :math:`b`. Classification is
done by projecting data points onto a set of hyperplanes, the distance to
which is used to determine a class membership probability.

Mathematically, this can be written as:

.. math::
  P(Y=i|x, W,b) &= softmax_i(W x + b) \\
                &= \frac {e^{W_i x + b_i}} {\sum_j e^{W_j x + b_j}}


The output of the model or prediction is then done by taking the argmax of
the vector whose i'th element is P(Y=i|x).

.. math::

  y_{pred} = argmax_i P(Y=i|x,W,b)
